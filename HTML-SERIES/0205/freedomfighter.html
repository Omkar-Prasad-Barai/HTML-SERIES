		Sri Aurobindo Ghosh, an iconic freedom fighter of India, spearheaded the struggle against British colonialism in the early 		20th century. His radical views and fervent speeches inspired countless Indians to fight for independence. Despite his 			initial advocacy for revolutionary methods, Aurobindo's journey took a spiritual turn after a transformative experience. He 		later withdrew from politics to delve into yoga and spiritual teachings, leaving an enduring legacy as a patriot and 			spiritual visionary in India's quest for freedom.
